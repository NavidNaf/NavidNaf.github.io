                <span class="p2">I've always had a passion for learning and exploring topics
                    that leave me astounded, which made me drive to engineering. Engineering helped me to learn and develop as a human being in ways that I could not imagine in my wildest dreams. During my 4 years in engineering school, I learned to test myself both academically and by extra-curricular activities. I've even committed myself to improving me in every way imaginable. I was Chair of IEEE IUT Student Branch, President of IUT Career and Business Society, and I held Esonance 2019 - Bangladesh's one of the biggest university tech events. Looking ahead, I plan to pursue my master's career and become one of the world's biggest pentesters and researchers. And may win the Nobel Prize someday. It might seem crazy. Yet I enjoy having crazy fantasies. What is the achievement in gaining
                something easily?</span>
