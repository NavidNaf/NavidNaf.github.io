                <p><em>Chapter 2 of My Series on Business Communications Skills. This was a course of my final semester undergraduate studies. These chapters are a collection of my study and research on Business Communication Skills while doing my undergrad.</em></p>
                <p><em>Keywords: Pareto, Communication Principles, Purpose of Business Communication, Barrier to effective communication, 4 Steps Communication Process, Communication Pyramid,  Communication Image, Communication Cooperation</em></p>
                <h4>Communication and Co-Operation</h4>
                <p>The more skilled you are at communicating, the more often jobs will be done correctly and finished on time.</p>
                <p>You are a good manager, leader, or organizer in business terms because you use persuasive communication to create co-operation.</p>
                <p>Ethical Persuasion should respect the rights, goals, and emotions of everyone concerned. Should not involve – Overriding of people’s needs and getting whatever one wants at any cost.</p>
                <h4>Questions to Think About</h4>
                <p><em>A team leader wants their group to accept a new roster. The leader knows the new system will benefit all concerned, but to begin with, nobody will agree. How far should the leader use powers of persuasion to make the group cooperate and accept the plan?</em></p>
                <p><em>Is it fair to use your skills as a communicator to persuade people to cooperate by paying their accounts on time? Is it OK to use the same skills to sell cosmetics at a party plan function to someone who has little need for the product and cannot afford it?</em></p>
                <p><em>Sometimes people who have your best interests at heart try to stop you from doing something that could get you into trouble. How far should they go in using persuasion to prevent you from doing it?</em></p>
                <h4>Why Don’t People Co-Operate?</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Indirect Opposition</li>
                    <li>The person to communicate is not on the same page as me. Persuasion based on sentiment or emotional appeal can help overcome this type of opposition.</li>
                    <li>Different Goals</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Goals are different from mine. Logical Reasoning is the key to success.</p>
                <p><strong>Justifiable Opposition</strong> - If the reasons are justifiable, then I should be the one to co-operate.</p>
                <p><strong>Unjustified Opposition</strong> - Selfish and Unwilling – Not interested in what I want.</p>
                <h4>Interpersonal Communication</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li><em>Aggressive, Passivity, Manipulativeness – Flaws: Ineffective, Stressful, and Counterproductive.</em></li>
                    <li><em>Assertiveness – Most significant way to communicate, interact with other people.</em></li>
                </ol>
                <p>Example of Assertiveness: Would you..; this would mean…; I would feel…</p>
                <h4>Communication Pyramid</h4>
                <p>A complex network of attitudes, beliefs, prejudices, assumptions, ideas, associations, emotions, and memories.</p>
                <p><strong>The Pareto Principle</strong> can often apply to communication, as well as many other aspects of the business. The Pareto Principle (also known as the 80-20 rule) states that about 80% of the consequences are produced by 20% of
                    the causes for many phenomena.</p>
                <p>Expanding the business with 80/20 rule. 20% effort for important results in 80% better yield.</p>

                <h4>Key Takeaways</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>The law of 80-20 claims that 80% of outputs (outputs) come from 20% of triggers (inputs).</li>
                    <li>You consider the 20 percent of factors in the 80-20 rule that will yield the best results.</li>
                    <li>A concept of rule 80-20 is to identify the best assets of an organization and make efficient use of them to generate maximum value.</li>
                    <li>This “rule” is a guideline and not a hard-and-fast math statute.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The essence of the 80-20 rule is to define the best assets of an organization and use them effectively to achieve full value. For example, a student will seek to determine which sections of a textbook would produce the most amount for
                    an upcoming test and concentrate on those first. However, that doesn’t mean the student can neglect the other sections of the textbook.</p>
                <h4>Observation or Science?</h4>
                <p>The Pareto rule is a matter of observation. This is not scientifically verified. There is always a possibility, therefore, that the rule may not suit all situations. Any legitimate application will deal with clearly distinct data points
                    which would have been established in any concise explanation of the procedure. As was acknowledged, the fundamental mathematical relationship representing any complex process would be different.</p>
                <h4>Communication Model</h4>
                <p>When one communicates, he/she is trying to establish commonality with another person. Share information – Verbal/Non-Verbal Communication.</p>
                <p>Communication process requires four elements;</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>A Message</li>
                    <li>A Source of this Message</li>
                    <li>A Communication Channel</li>
                    <li>A Reciever</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The information you want to share needs to be encoded into transmittable form, transmitted, and decoded by the receiver. Noise – Anything that distorts the message. Final element of the process – Feedback.</p>
