                <p>
                    You will fail. – This is a Universal truth.</p>
                <p>Failure is both natural and necessary. The growth of a person depends considerably on the difficulties that a person faces on his or her journey. In most cases, people tend to take failure as a negative set of feelings, hanging around
                    their heads.</p>
                <p>Failure is one part of a learning process that increases future success.</p>
                <p>I’ve failed all the time in my life, and I’ve started to cultivate the idea that I need to benefit from it rather than be discouraged.</p>
                <p>People prefer to neglect and conceal their disappointment. Failure to recognize leads to compassion, modesty, courage, and perspective.</p>
                <p>What exactly is failure?</p>
                <h4>Depth</h4>
                <p>We always welcome success. On another hand, we don’t welcome failure. We need to change the way we’re thinking about failure. Success is a performance in the learning process. Holding that in mind, failure is one aspect of a learning process
                    that will improve potential success.</p>
                <p>But we know very well that drawing this conclusion is difficult for the largest number of people. And that’s because of fear. We’re afraid to lose. Fear of failure is the primary reason people struggle to set their personal goals and instead
                    set low professional goals. It is important to remember that this fear is not really motivated by our level of self-confidence. This affects us, because our fear of failure is socially generated. The fear of failure actually begins
                    with the way we are actually taught. Desire to get a good grade, but fear to get a bad grade, makes fear grow even larger, and implements the fear is just a mental mechanism.</p>
                <p>Our society is focused on rivalry. You can find nothing but competitions in every area of life. To compete with each other in order to achieve something.</p>
                <p>What are the most terrible fears? – Fear not to get it right. Questioning the intellect. Failure to accept it. – Such concerns may be justified, but they are by no means successful.</p>
                <p>We have to remember, Failure is a part of life. A tiny clip of a long piece of video. And fear of failure does not describe us. When we have more confidence in fear than we do, we begin a cycle of failure. If we allow our failure to submerge
                    us, we are simply – preventing failure, resisting it, accumulating all the failures, and finally facing a collapse.</p>
                <p><em>Failure is normal and necessary.</em></p>
                <p>When we begin to understand this, we begin to benefit from it.</p>
                <h4>Failure makes us Learn</h4>
                <p>Everyone fails. Look back to the history of any successful personnel, what will you find common between them? Failure. Yes, everyone failed at any stage of their lives. And they changed their loss to success, only because they were more
                    determined to learn from it, rather than allowing it to take over.</p>
                <p>Tenacity and perseverance would be the first solution to failure. Not only do we fail one time, but we fail many times. Yet we taste the success even less than the disappointment, but the taste of overcoming the loss with the success you
                    wished for is something you love all the time.</p>
                <p>Think of the most famous example of Robert Bruce, who lost six times but saw a spider attempting to web six times in a row to fail and succeed in the seventh attempt, inspired him, and gave him the motivation to fight for the seventh time,
                    resulting in his victory.</p>
                <p>We should embrace the success cycle – Try. Fail. Learn. Succeed.</p>
                <p>Try, fail, and learn will repeat several times before we finally get a taste of success.</p>
                <p>We’ve got to fail to taste success. Around the same time, we have to accept the meaning of seeking and working to find our way to accomplish something. We need to be immune to the negative aspects of failure. If we start learning from
                    mistakes, we will be diligent in our work and wise to face risks.</p>
                <p>The objective of a specific task should not be successful. Rather, to benefit from the experience of achieving that particular performance. We must be welcome to face challenges and take challenges in order to increase our potential.</p>
                <p>A long-term failure can define your claim to success. On the opposite, a long-term success may mean that you’re playing it safe. Take minor chances or not. It’s because when a big gamble is taken, that’s what failure is behind.</p>
                <h4>Types of Failures</h4>
                <h4>Personal Errors</h4>
                <p>It refers to errors that occur due to lack of skill, concentration, or poor team / work fitness.</p>
                <h4>External or Contextual Factors</h4>
                <p>Factors beyond our influence. All kinds of things are unpredictable, and confusion will lead to mistakes. That depends on the situation. A bad situation could lead to a failure of tasks. Mitigation: Create a strategy and then execute a
                    contingency plan for critical tasks. Planning for contingency is a must. Educating yourself to a changing world and to methodologies.</p>
                <h4>Striving Effects</h4>
                <p>Failures in the name of development, progress, and creativity. Example: Pioneering, attempting something different that has not been done, could lead to a failure due to a sudden change in context. Then push the boundaries, too. Doing
                    things when you have a small place to deal with it.</p>
                <p>Now comes the problem of playing it safe or taking chances. One has to engage in the truth surrounding the issues. It’s meant to be done or not. What are the odds of that? What is the outcome of the process?</p>
                <h4>Owning the Mistakes</h4>
                <p>Everyone makes mistakes, but not everyone understands why they have to own their mistakes. It’s because acknowledging your mistakes is always the first step towards learning from a setback. It’s about knowing that you’re responsible for
                    any or all of the bad consequences that have just occurred.</p>
                <h4>Why people don’t own up to their errors? –</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Easy to blame someone else. BLAME – Barely Legitimate Almost Meaningless Excuse. Blame game is never productive. We tend to shift our mistakes on people’s heads so that we can be on the safe side and not learn ourselves from the mistakes
                        that we have done.</li>
                    <li>People don’t speak up. People know that they are partially or fully to blame for a thing, but they don’t speak up, rather be silent about their mistakes.</li>
                    <li>We are avoiding the burden of defending ourselves. We prefer to cover ourselves for the mistakes we’ve done. We’re starting to offer needless logics that don’t hold the fact that we haven’t failed.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Owning a mistake is a good one. We’re not perfect. We’ve got to accept our imperfection. We need to accept this fact in order to drive ourselves, to succeed, to inspire ourselves to work harder. So, how are we expected to own a failure
                    –?
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>We need to understand our contributions.</li>
                    <li>We need to admit the mistakes that we have done.</li>
                    <li>If needed, we are obliged to offer an explanation.</li>
                    <li>We need to explain our learnings and intentions through our work.</li>
                    <li>Follow through all the tasks and work hard to achieve.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Benefits of owning a mistake –</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Fast and efficient learning.</li>
                    <li>Expresses our integrity and willingness to take on responsibility.</li>
                    <li>Creating reality and providing people with relatable thoughts.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>We have to remember: Mistakes are catalysts to learning.</p>
                <h4>Causes of Failure</h4>
                <p>We need to reflect on the adoption of a learning mindset. We need to be open to all sorts of possibilities. We need to look backwards often to step forward. So, that leaves us to conclude that – if we choose to move forward, and if we
                    fail, we need to hunch back to the root cause of the problem, the choices we made that caused the failure. We need to start looking at our assumptions. What are the ways in which our weakness, our loss, may have been caused? We do
                    need to remind ourselves why the question has arisen. Why did we have to face the situation?</p>
                <p>We do need to be open to suggestions. Feedback is the catalyst that accelerates the learning process. But we do need to get guidance from others. The argument is clear, you can often reduce uncertainty quicker by taking advantage of what
                    others know about the particular issue you’re working on. The hardest part of deciding what went wrong after a loss is to make the choice to face the challenge and fix it. That’s how you turn the loss into a spark for future progress.</p>
                <h4>Making Failure a Tool</h4>
                <p>Unfortunately, so many people don’t feel that it’s all right to speak frankly about the simple reality that we’re all imperfect. And they’re covering the mistakes and not thinking about shortcomings. We need to bear in mind that happy
                    and productive people are coping with reality, accepting mistakes, and learning from failure. – Doing this improves your <strong>Trustworthiness, Authenticity, and Approachability.</strong> Failure brings higher quality and innovative
                    work.
                </p>
                <p>Openly stating and failing, and seeking to learn from the errors you have made, is evidence of your authenticity. In every area of our work, we need to project honest humanity. Mere awareness of particular occasions that you came up short,
                    made a poor decision, or even saw a project go up in flames is incredibly useful in helping people see your achievements past in order to make you more full. Authenticity contributes to trustworthiness. And authenticity and trustworthiness
                    make people more available to you.</p>
                <p>Wonder the occasions that people hesitate or try to approach you, it’s because of the honesty and trustworthiness that people don’t see in you. And you’re going to need to develop yourself for authenticity.</p>
                <p>Collaboration is more efficient than dictation. The more you share the full human version of yourself, the more people will be able to share with you.</p>
                <h4>Development</h4>
                <p>We need to know how to frame failures positively. With practice, you will learn something useful, and your everyday attitude will become better. Embracing failures leads to compassion, humility, courage, and perspective.</p>
                <h4>Compassion</h4>
                <p>Humans are programmed to judge, and often they think arrogant thoughts. The more you want to face your mistakes honestly, to own them and learn from them, the more you will be able to understand that others are as flawed as you are and
                    often fail. Instead of judging, you’re going to be a bit more open about what others may be feeling. You’re going to act with more kindness, and they’re more likely to reciprocate with compassion.</p>
                <h4>Humility</h4>
                <p>We need to remember that – no matter how good your abilities or accomplishments might be, you know how imperfect you are, so you behave a little more modestly and kindly.</p>
                <h4>Courage</h4>
                <p>Passion can be easily left inside and unused. It’s the confidence that’s going to let passion out. It’s the courage that allows enthusiasm to embrace change and transformation in your life. We need to face failure in a positive way.</p>
                <h4>Perspective</h4>
                <p>Failure offers a wider, longer-term viewpoint. Single failure is a single career data point, and learning from that single failure will help you improve, it won’t define you.</p>
                <p>Know more from failure than from success.</p>
                <h4>Self-Improvement</h4>
                <p>Stuff that you should say yourself to better yourself –</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Identify the shortcomings.</li>
                    <li>Ask yourself why this was a mistake.</li>
                    <li>Look for input from others.</li>
                    <li>Compare statements to circumstances.</li>
                </ol>
