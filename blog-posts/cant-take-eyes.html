                <h4>Foreword</h4>
                <p>I’ve been in love since my childhood. Those who know me, may not be able to connect what I will be saying in the next lines, with me. You may judge myself as a nerd, reading this. But I prefer saying, intellectual badass (I know it’s cheezy!
                    But I always wanted to tell this in the tone of Batman, obviously Christian Bale one!)</p>
                <p>Since my childhood, I’ve been in love with Mathematics. Yes, you heard it right. But, I will always regret betraying my love. </p>
                <h4><em>‘Yes, I have betrayed you, my love. Maths’</em></h4>
                <p>My mother is a math school teacher and since childhood she always taught me to look into the astounding world of mathematics, inspired me. I loved the way how mathematics worked. The charm, the art, the craft always startled me.</p>
                <p>But I was always confined to the bookish mathematics and it derivatives. Never have I ever came across the vast world of mathematics until I was in class 7.</p>
                <p>My school used to host the Bangladesh Regional Mathematical Olympiad. And I for the first time participated in the Dhaka regional Olympiad also that year. And having ‘zero’ knowledge I was literally thrashed by the sets of problems I faced.
                    But I wasn’t upset, rather I was so happy that it made me more interested. So, I trained myself and came back again the next year, but………. </p>
                <p>I was thrashed again. This time, it hit me. May be I was not blessed with the brains who solved these. May be I am less gifted. I started lagging in confidence and I never participated again, left the world of mathematics. Stopped training.
                    I was not confident enough. </p>
                <h4>…………………………………………………………….</h4>
                <p>One fine day I was preparing myself for the exams in my college, I went through all the maths thoroughly. One thing before approaching further, I need to state, is that, till then I lost my love for mathematics. So when I sat for the math
                    exam, I knew all the questions, I practiced it all, but I was not able to solve them. But Why? </p>
                <p>Something hit me. That was the biggest betrayal ever. I was blank. I was submerged in deep hollowness. </p>
                <p>I was memorizing the mathematics, rather than understanding it. I cried (Yes, I cried a lot.). </p>
                <p>But, that was the time I felt myself motivated, again. But it was too late. Too late to start from scratch. Too late to hike the world of mathematics as an Olympian…………</p>
                <p>Rest of the story, may be told another time. But the main agenda of this writing is not telling my story but to let the readers know, which problem set made me so dazed that I can’t take my eyes of it. So here it goes. </p>
                <h4>The Legend of Problem 6</h4>
                <p>It's a mystery to nobody that maths is hard, so when you start discussing the hardest maths problem ever, things begin to get somewhat insane. Take the harmlessly named Question 6, which is so perplexing, it can carry mathematicians to
                    tears.
                </p>
                <p>The problem was set in the International Mathematics Olympiad in 1988, Australia. And the question no. 6 was one of the hardest till date.</p>
                <p>In 1988, the Australian Olympiad authorities chose to toss a monstrous curveball to the children on the last day of competition, and it's stood out forever as perhaps the hardest problems out there. </p>
                <p>Just to give you a thought of how extreme it was, Australian-American mathematician Terence Tao - beneficiary of the 2006 Fields Medal (the mathematician's 'Nobel Prize') - scored a 1 out of 7 when he attempted it.</p>
                <h4>Problem Statement</h4>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td><em><strong>Let a and b be positive integers such that ab + 1 divides a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup>. Show that a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> / ab + 1 is the square of an integer.</strong></em></td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>So, I went on to search for the solutions. How the f did they solve it. The Solution to this problem is stated below. </p>
                <h4>Solution`</h4>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td><em><strong>Let k = a<sup> 2</sup>+b<sup> 2</sup>/ ab+1 . Fix k and consider all pairs (a, b) of nonnegative integers (a, b) satisfying the equation
                            a 2 + b 2 / ab + 1 = k,<br>
                            
                            that is, consider S = { (a, b) ∈ N × N | a<sup> 2</sup> + b<sup> 2</sup>/ ab + 1 = k }.<br>
                            We claim that among all such pairs in S, there exists a pair (a, b) such that b = 0 and k = a<sup>2</sup> . In order to prove this claim, suppose that k is not a perfect square and suppose that (A, B) ∈ S is the pair which minimizes the sum a + b over all such pairs (if there exist more than one such pair in S, choose an arbitrary one). Without loss of generality, assume that A ≥ B > 0. Consider the equation<br><br>
                            x<sup>2</sup> + B<sup>2</sup>/xB + 1= k,<br>
                            which is equivalent to x<sup>2</sup> − kB • x + B<sup>2</sup> − k = 0<br>
                            as a quadratic equation in x. We know that x1 = A is one root of this equation. By Vieta’s formula, the other root of this equation is<br>
                            x<sup>2</sup> = kB − A = B<sup>2</sup> – k/ A .<br>
                            The first equation implies that x<sup>2</sup> is an integer, the second that x<sup>2</sup> != 0, otherwise, k = B<sup>2</sup> would be a perfect square, contradicting our assumption. Also, x<sup>2</sup> cannot be negative, for otherwise,<br><br>
                            (x <sup>2</sup>) <sup>2</sup> − kBx<sup>2</sup> + B <sup>2</sup> − k ≥ (x <sup>2</sup>) <sup>2</sup> + k + B <sup>2</sup> − k > 0,<br>
                            a contradiction. Hence x<sup>2</sup> ≥ 0 and thus (x<sup>2</sup>, B) ∈ S. Because A ≥ B, we have<br>
                            x<sup>2</sup> = B<sup>2</sup> − k /A < A,<br>
                            so x<sup>2</sup> + B < A + B, contradicting the minimality of A + B.
                            </strong></em></td>
