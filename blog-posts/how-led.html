                <p>
                    <em>“The moment you give up, is the moment you let someone else win.”</em>– Kobe Bryant</p>
                <p>I’ve never given up in my life, and I’ve always learned from what I’ve done. Every single experience in my life mattered to me, and it shaped me into what I am now.</p>
                <p>Mixed with fun and most crucial duties. I was in charge of three major tasks in my undergraduate life, which helped me develop, learn and build. I’m sharing some of my past and what I’ve learned from that past.</p>
                <h4>Listen</h4>
                <p>Listening is really important, so it’s important to listen and be open. Listening is a difficult job, and indeed, you have to listen to succeed. We should agree on one topic, it’s that, none of us is as smart as all of us. So, a person
                    who thinks he’s right and doesn’t listen to anybody will cling to his own decision – that’s the mistake. There are a few ways to listen –</p>
                <p><strong>Listen to affirm.</strong> Listen to things that you know. And what are the advantages of this type of listening – you make yourself feel better about the kind of knowledge or experience you have. You know you don’t really push
                    the discussion, however you acknowledge yourself.</p>
                <p>One of my several experiences: I used to buzz out people that, ‘Hey, I already know that. Don’t make me listen to that again.’ But gradually I realized this is not a great way of communicating rather I am boasting myself or discouraging
                    the one who is sharing their part of the story with me. But gradually I changed this habit and looked into people’s perspectives. Now I know, how each people are sharing and their point of view.</p>
                <p><strong>Listen to defend.</strong>What happens when you are defending? You are basically surrounding yourself with the thoughts you hold. You should defend your thoughts when you think that your thoughts hold meaning. Not defend it for
                    the fact that you are always right, but for the fact that you are confident of your ideas. To lead is to innovate, is about changing the status quo and challenging the status quo.</p>
                <p><strong>Listen to discover.</strong>Listen to get acquainted with new things, new challenges. Listen to learn about everything, things you don’t know about.</p>
                <h4>You</h4>
                <p>To make a greater impact, take your focus away from yourself. You’re not going to try and represent ‘You are the best and you should change the game.’ The people you’re working with every day; the crowd you’re talking to are the ones that
                    inspire you. You’re not the one that inspires you.</p>
                <p>A simple analogy: Think you are playing cricket. Don’t think of scoring the 50 or the 100. Score for the teammates, the audience. So, that you can reach the target with ease.</p>
                <p>Phrase your goals and desires in terms of the impact that it means for others. Affirm yourself all the time with<br> <em>“I’ve thought this through”.</em></p>
                <p>I recall when my team and I organized ‘Esonance’ (The annual Electrical and Electronic Engineering Fest of Islamic University of Technology), I know there were a lot of tasks, which were beyond possible. And was asked constantly to perform
                    that, I didn’t think of myself then. Rather I said to myself “I’ve thought this through” and yes, I was successful to make my audience happy.</p>
                <p>
                    <em>“Leaders look in the direction of impact. They talk in terms of outcomes, and they think about impact, and impact, not just for themselves, but for the people that they serve.”</em>– Chris Westfall</p>
                <p>You is the most important pronoun. And when I changes to you, then you are running on the correct path.</p>
                <p>Let me give some examples of worst conversation starters –</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>I am an expert in this field.</li>
                    <li>I did the whole thing.</li>
                    <li>Let me tell you what you don’t know.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Instead –</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>This field is vast and from the experience I had, I think we should……</li>
                    <li>The work was easy to do/tiresome to do.</li>
                    <li>Do you know……?</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Which sentences are the best? You decide.</p>
                <p>Recognize the audience. Stay on a common field. Don’t turn up with the fact that ‘I know’ but prove that ‘we know it together.’</p>
                <h4>Common Ground</h4>
                <p>Common ground is what produces unexpected results, and you want people to see the commonality instead of your knowledge.</p>
                <p>People often assume that a discussion needs to be adversarial, or if I have a point of view that it’s going to be opposed to someone else. But throwing away this thought and sticking to the common ground with your audience, having the
                    same goal, is a victory.</p>
                <h4>Being in the Moment</h4>
                <p>Thought plays a role in people being able to access their true leadership skills and really be at their best.</p>
                <p>There are moments when there was so much pressure that I felt I was going to resign. I was talking about why I signed up for this? How am I doing these things that are continually pushing me, making me anxious.</p>
                <p>Let me tell you a story that will make it easier to understand—</p>
                <p>So, I had to complete a design that had to be delivered the next day. My laptop didn’t have a battery, so there was a possibility of a short circuit since it was attached to the power line all the time. I went outside to take a stroll,
                    and I found my laptop off when I came back. So, I thought, most likely, the switch was pushed. So I was trying to launch my laptop again. But it’s not taking control. The laptop didn’t turn on. I have changed the power ports, but the
                    situation has stayed the same. I began to have a panic attack because the next day, I had to deliver everything. I began to cry, yes, I was crying. My family began to get nervous, I was so paranoiac that I forgot about the other options
                    that could be made. My father just replaced the wire of the charger, and my laptop switched on.</p>
                <p>Moments are taking you through difficulties. So, what was meant to be done? Keep it cool. You’ve got to keep your mind free from pressures, scavenge the alternatives, the possibilities. Live the moment, don’t think about the moment. And
                    every obstacle in my life has given me a new kind of problem to solve. Life is not easy, act upon it, be in a moment to scavenge the best choices you can have.</p>
                <h4>How to Keep Calm</h4>
                <p>How to Keep Calm Access yourself. Get the best in you. Think of what you should do. Consider of the options you have to fix the dilemma you’re going through. Keep the other thoughts quiet. And also keep this in mind – <em>just because a train of thought shows up doesn’t mean you have to ride that train.</em></p>
                <p><em>“For there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so.”</em>– William Shakespeare</p>
                <h4>Experience</h4>
                <p>Experience is educating you. Learn from the experiences you’ve had. Your every step of life is important. Your next step helps you to push towards the target you’ve got. Each part of life offers you the opportunity to tackle it. So, learn
                    from whatever experience you have. The simplest of decisions will lead you to a tougher solution through your experience.</p>
                <h4>Win Pt. 1 </h4>
                <p>Effective communication is the best way to win a conversation. How is that? Think of a scenario where your teammates will not consent to a particular decision that you have suggested because it is too dangerous.</p>
                <p>So what you do? Research the risk factors for this. How do they think it’s a hindrance? What should be done? What are the advantages of your suggestion over their solution? After evaluating, if you think you’re wrong, let their recommendations
                    live. If they are wrong, apply your conclusions, your analysis, and give them a legitimate and credible reason to consider your suggestion.</p>
                <p>Yet note, if you implement the wrong suggestion; or, if you take the wrong suggestion from others, realize the mistake, and fail to change their mind — You FAIL there.</p>
                <h4>Win Pt. 2</h4>
                <p>How to win a conversation or a situation –</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Align with the stakeholders.</li>
                    <li>Don’t forget your stakes.</li>
                    <li>Be affirmative.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Don’t ‘To-Do’</h4>
                <p>A lot of people adopt a to-do list to remind themselves of the things that need to be done. I used to follow a to-do list, jotting everything I had to do during the day, during the week, and a few times during the month. Yet, to my experience,
                    this is the worst way to keep the career going.</p>
                <p>I used to set the tasks in my head, and I went through them repeatedly. Since your mind is what controls you, and you are the one that controls your mind.</p>
                <h4>Do it at a Time</h4>
                <p>It’s obvious you’re going to be flooded with tasks and deadlines. So you’re going to find it hard to deal with when to do what. You’re going to be juggling tasks, doing multiple tasks at a time. Don’t do it. Perform one thing at a time.
                    Once this is done, tackle the next thing to address. If that’s hard, skip to the next one and go back to the next one after ending.</p>
                <h4>You Are Allowed to Procrastinate A Bit</h4>
                <p>As you’re going to be loaded with tasks, sometimes you’re going to find it hard to complete it all at a time or on a day. So, the next day, you may set the tasks. But don’t do it deliberately. Do it when you think you should – there are
                    no other choices left.</p>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>Those are all my experiences, and they’re not in any way equivalent to top-notch leaders who have been ace and ace in their lives. Here are the simplest insights I’ve shared from my past to any enthusiast who’s willing to know. My learning
                    doesn’t stop here though, I am always in the process of learning, and I hope that I can succeed in my life with the things I learn. One last suggestion – You don’t lead by hitting people over the head, that’s assault, not leadership
                    and don’t let leadership get into your head.</p>
