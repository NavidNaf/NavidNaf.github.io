                <h4>Diplomacy 101</h4>
                <h4>Four Team Qualities that Yield Results</h4>
                <h4>Tactical Empathy</h4>
                <p>Trying to get in the heads of your colleagues, in their shoes. Ask: What are their goals, their fears and their desires? We ought to consider strategic grandiosity when we are comfortable in our counterpart’s thinking. Diplomatic way of
                    thought set up.</p>
                <p>We should consider what theatrical move (act) we should make to put pressure on the other side, to get what we want. And we also need to leverage some symbols of our own side’s strength, playing a gamble of my own strength to achieve what
                    we want.</p>
                <h4>Deep Expertise</h4>
                <p>Diplomacy is very useful as it brings historicism to the table. History can be the most undervalued and useful weapon of the negotiators. Pressure to the pressure point of the area.</p>
                <p>Will you have a critical mass of core experts who understand the behavior of your counterpart in the context?</p>
                <p>Understanding the context, interpreting it, applying it to pressure points. History repeats itself, so consider it as a human trait.</p>
                <h4>Diversity</h4>
                <p>Diversity is a must for teamwork. A variety of thoughts and histories. Effective negotiators combine institutional memory with a startling point of view.</p>
                <p>Have you found a balance on the team? What are the players with unorthodox or contradictory ideas?</p>
                <p>Diverse minds – upholds the credibility of a point.</p>
                <h4>Patience</h4>
                <p>It isn’t going to come as quickly as you thought. Therefore, you need to be cautious in order to really get the desired result. The key to diplomacy. Diplomacy may feel sluggish and incomplete, but patience and endurance seem to pay off.</p>
                <p>How do you keep the talks going no matter how hard they get?</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Q: How does “Tactical Empathy” differ from “Empathy” alone?</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>A. Empathy refers to the desire of someone to understand and express their feelings. Tactical Empathy, on the other hand, relates to the dramatic way to approach and get what we want from a specific discussion. Using symbols from
                            our own sides to get what we really want from a specific agreement with the counterpart.</td>

                <h4>Making Deals Like and FBI Negotiator</h4>
                <h4>Get the Reasons You Won’t Make a Deal Out of the Way</h4>
                <p>The way you won’t make a deal.</p>
                <h4>Preempt Negative Thinking</h4>
                <p>Empathy is simply a way of thinking person to person in response to input from the other person. Feeding back to them, letting them think that you’ve got it. Understand and show comprehension.</p>
                <p>Tactical Empathy is an understanding of how people’s emotions drive them.</p>
                <p>Example: When you know your counterpart is driven by a fear of loss, act to defuse his fear first. Become more rational and make him and open frame. Tactically in empathy, need to address the fears first.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Need to address the fear specifically.</li>
                    <li>If you suspect that your counterpart won’t like what you have to say, begin with “You’re not going to like this…..”</li>
                </ol>
                <p>There is an important distinction between recognizing a negative and denying a negative. Recognize the negatives and don’t deny them. Useful catches in these situations –</p>
                <p><em>“This is going to sound really harsh.”</em></p>
                <p><em>“There’s a good chance you’re not going to like me after I say this.”</em></p>
                <h4>Diminish Negative Emotions</h4>
                <p>Label the emotion that is driving the counterpart. This includes what you think you see and what you expect to see.</p>
                <p>“It Seems Like”/ “It Sounds Like” / “It Looks Like”</p>
                <p>Nothing should be branded with negative emotions. We need to carry out an audit of the accusation. Taking stock in advance of any negative or unfair stuff that your counterpart may think about you. This involves – how they feel right now
                    and how they may feel in response to any different movements.</p>
                <p>Simply put, judge people’s emotions before they make a move. Think about the possibilities of a moment, and then decide what he would react to the options that I can choose from. Simply setting myself in the person’s shoes.</p>
                <p>Judge accordingly. Appreciate if good. Diminish the negative emotions. The reasons you won’t make a deal are typically more important than the reasons you will make a deal.</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Q: Recommending the direct approach: labeling the other side’s apparent emotions and “outing” your own tough stances?</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>A. It’s because we need to put ourselves in their shoes. By labeling the other side’s emotions we can achieve what we want to achieve or get. According judgment is a dire need in this approach.</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <h4>Mitigate Risk on All Sides</h4>
                <h4>Solve for the Pyramid</h4>
                <p>Thinking in a one dimensional way is not good. We often enter any negotiations with a one-dimensional view of the situation and for that we tend to look for a one-dimensional solution.</p>
                <p>So sharing information to gather a multi-dimensional knowledge is needed. We should give the other party the benefit of the doubt. To decide that you will believe someone, even though you are not sure that what the person is saying is
                    true. Sharing the perspective with one another will create a multi-dimensional view.</p>
                <p>Exchange of information disappears each side’s perception that there are only 2 possible outcomes: Win or Lose. One has to together toward a multi-dimensional solution where both sides will get what they want. But there might be a slight
                    chance of a person’s moving unsatisfied.</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Q. How can zero-sum thinking harm both sides​in any negotiation? Q. In what sense does information-sharing lead to a “three-dimensional” picture of the opportunities in any negotiation?</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <p>The way to mitigate risk for everybody is to solve for the whole pyramid. In doing so, you lower the stakes, reducing the likelihood of drastic, damaging action. Many situations that seem to be “zero-sum” have multiple “win-win” potential
                    outcomes, if you take the trouble to consider them.</p>
                <p>That means de-escalating, taking a step back and rationally considering the options. It means treating dialog as a valuable tool for communication rather than an act of unreasonable compromise. It’s worth the investment because it’s better
                    than the uncertainties of a zero-sum game and the expense of going back to the same negotiation table in the future.</p>
                <h4>Constructing Powerful Arguments</h4>
                <h4>Wield Your Data in an Emotional Way</h4>
                <h4>Getting Facts Straight First</h4>
                <p>A claim is not a fact. It may be thought, believed or maybe a fact but is not a fact. Firstly we have to understand the things that we are claiming, is it a part of my subjective experience or is it an objective fact? Subjective means
                    something which does not show the clear picture or it is just a person’s outlook or expression of opinion. An objective statement is based on facts and observations. Feeling your claim being a fact, does not enclose that it is actually
                    a fact.</p>
                <p>Am I infecting my facts with my feelings and opinions?</p>
                <p>Emotions do matter but they must be used effectively. So, the question arises, how do I use my emotions to make a more impactful argument?</p>
                <h4>Connect at the Human Level</h4>
                <p>Evidence does not change people’s mind easily. People are attracted by emotions more that by the data. So we need to wield it in an emotional way.</p>
                <p>When talking to the counterpart, enwrapping the facts in emotion, experiences, and relationships are much more convenient. Because, the emotions are the things that attracts people the most. We need to go beyond proving our opponent wrong.
                    We need to use the emotions to convince the person of our point of view.</p>
                <h4>Science of Strategic Thinking</h4>
                <p>Game Theory describes strategic thinking more impactful. When we are trying to achieve something, the other person is as well trying everything to achieve that or something.</p>
                <p>Improve Negotiation Outcomes with 2 Central Principles from Game Theory</p>
                <h4>1. Patience</h4>
                <p>Will and resilient to stay and continue to negotiate.</p>
                <p>Example: You go to a shop and ask for something and tell that it is urgent. The shopkeeper will take the moments advantage. But not telling your urgency but acting normal may result in a better deal.</p>
                <p>So patience here is very important. Make the counterpart believe that I am more patient than the other person. The person who has less to lose from letting the negotiation drag out typically comes out on top. Positioning yourself so that
                    you can afford to be patient.</p>
                <h4>2. Take it or Leave it</h4>
                <p>Positioning yourself to take it or leave it position. Don’t bluff. Make sure the offer is a true take it or leave it.</p>
