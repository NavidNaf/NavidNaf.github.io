                <p><em>Below here is a fiction written by me. Well, a fan fiction which I submitted last year in the Mazecity Fanfiction Contest. It luckily obtained 4th place in public choice award. You may find some similarities to English for Today (English text book of Bangladesh) with this fictions introduction part. Some characters used here:</em></p>
                <ol>
                    <li><em>Captain Levi – Attack on Titan</em></li>
                    <li><em>Hououin Kyoma/Okabe, Mayuri, Dari – Steins;Gate</em></li>
                    <li><em>Colonel Roy Mustang – Full Metal Alchemist.</em></li>
                </ol>
                <p>2nd April, 2006. Mr Richards disappeared. He left his flat about 5’o clock in the evening. Going off in the direction of the Atsu riverbank, he disappeared. His next door neighbour Mr Stewart saw him go. A bus driver named Allen Gomes
                    saw him crossing the railway track. A carpenter Mr Parker, who had worked for him, had met him on the village footpath about seven kilometres away from his home when he had come to pay some money that he owed Mr Parker.</p>
                <p>“I’ve seen a big bundle of hundred dollar bills in Mr Richards’s hand”, said Mr Parker.</p>
                <p>The last person who saw him that day was Mrs Lillian who lived in the same building in another flat. She had met Mr Richards by the river while she was having a walk.</p>
                <p>Early next morning Mr Richards’s neighbours organized a search party. Near the forest by the banks of the river, they found his hat and stick. Samuel, youngest of them took those up. Then the party gradually moved into the forest. After
                    walking for 10-15 minutes they came across a swamp. The party was looking for Mr Richards behind the bushes, up on the trees and here and there.</p>
                <p>Suddenly Mrs Lillian started shrieking in fear and started crying, “What’s that!? What’s that!?” directing her index finger to the swamp. A giant figure rose from the swamp. Samuel said in a low tone, “A SWAMP MONSTER!!!”</p>
                <p>The Swamp Monster was a transparent, thick-jelly like figure. Screaming and spitting its dirty-muddy saliva everywhere.</p>
                <p>The people of the search party were trembling in fear. Suddenly they heard a click and a blast of fire hit the swamp monster.</p>
                <p>A shadowy figure came right out of the darkness of the forest. It was the flame alchemist Colonel Roy Mustang.</p>
                <p>Samuel cried out in joy, “Roy Mustang has appeared! Roy Mustang has appeared! We’ll be saved now.”</p>
                <p>Roy Mustang started clicking his finger and blasting off flames but nothing happened to the swamp monster. None of his flames could vaporize the swamp monster. Then suddenly a spinning figure came out of that same direction of the forest.
                    It came and slayed down the swamp monster. Splitting it into pieces. The spinning figure was Captain Levi of the Recon Corps.</p>
                <p>Everyone was expressing their joy, shouting and screaming. Mr Parker made them silent and informed them, “Look! Look! The swamp monsters body is colliding again.”</p>
                <p>In a minute or two the swamp monster resurrected. Way larger, way more powerful. Screaming and shouting. Levi and Mustang started fighting the monster again. But they could do nothing.</p>
                <p>The Swamp Monster came out of the swamp and started moving towards the city. The search party with Mustang and Levi became confused, what could they do? Then suddenly a plan stroke Samuel.</p>
                <p>“Let’s call in the specialists”</p>
                <p>“What type of specialists?” asked Mustang.</p>
                <p>“The S.M.E.F.T.T.”, said Samuel.</p>
                <p>“The S.M.E.F.F…… What?” said Levi.</p>
                <p>“The S.M.E.F.T., The Swamp Monster Evading Force with Technological Talent”, said Samuel.</p>
                <p>Everyone looked at each other. “I’m serious.” said Samuel.</p>
                <p>“Never heard of these people”, said Mr Parker.</p>
                <p>“Do you know their contact number or anything else?” Levi asked</p>
                <p>“Yes, I know their contact number. Let me make a call”</p>
                <p>Samuel then started making a call, it started ringing. After ringing thrice someone answered the phone.</p>
                <p>“Hello! Is this S.M.E.F.T.T.?”, asked Samuel.</p>
                <p>“Yes! This is S.M.E.F.T.T. I am Hououin Kyouma speaking.”</p>
                <p>“We have found a swamp monster here, near the forest by the Atsu river bank, Can you guys bring in your force here”</p>
                <p>“Where did you say?”</p>
                <p>“The forest by the Atsu river bank”</p>
                <p>“There could not possibly be a swamp monster there!! Ok, we’ll come”</p>
                <p>Then the phone was cut. Samuel told the people that they were coming.</p>
                <p>In a minute or two, out of nowhere, three people teleported amongst the search party. Everyone was shocked. Samuel then cried, “S.M.E.F.T.T. has arrived.” Levi and Mustang startled. They both cried at the same time, “Okabe, Mayuri, and
                    Daru!! You guys are S.M.E.F….. Or whatever?”</p>
                <p>“We are not S.M.E.F… or whatever, we are The S.M.E.F.T.T. and I’m not Okabe, I am Mad Scientist Hououin Kyouma” said Okabe.</p>
                <p>“Alright! Alright! Now what happened to your future gadget lab?” asked Mustang.</p>
                <p>“This is our side business. Now stop chatting and let us handle the situation.”</p>
                <p>Mayuri, Daru, Okabe went near the swamp monster, checked out its trail. Mayuri touched a small piece of the swamp monsters body which was lying down the trail.</p>
                <p>“The skin is soft and squishy like the gel banana”, said Mayuri.</p>
                <p>“Hey Mayuri! Can you say ‘your banana is soft and squishy’ again”, said Daru.</p>
                <p>“Ok! Your banana is soft…”</p>
                <p>“Don’t make her say that, you pervert”, said Okabe.</p>
                <p>They investigated for half an hour and after hearing that no attack could kill that thing, they became indulged in great thought.</p>
                <p>“It’s like that gel-banana thing, we can use the phone microwave to see what it really is.”, said Daru.</p>
                <p>“Yes! You’re right! The future gadget #008, R-E-N-G, the phone microwave (name subject to change)”, said Okabe.</p>
                <p>“But it is too small, we need a bigger one”, said Mayushi.</p>
                <p>“Can you tell ‘I need a bigger one’ Mayushi”, said Daru.</p>
                <p>“I need a bi……..”</p>
                <p>“Stop that, you ‘Hentai’”, said Okabe “Let me teleport to the lab, I’ll make a larger one and come back as soon as possible. Till then Mustang and Levi, You help the guardians hold back the monster.”</p>
                <p>“Ok”, said Levi and Mustang.</p>
                <p>Okabe then went back to his Future Gadget Lab. Levi, Mustang, Absol and The Charizards were holding the swamp monster back. After an hour Okabe teleported amongst them with a big ‘microwave oven’ like thing.</p>
                <p>“Future Gadget #008.1.3, R-E-N-G, The larger phone microwa…..” Okabe was stopped by Levi,</p>
                <p>“Will you stop and do your job?”</p>
                <p>“Ok! Ok! I’ll open the door of the gadget. Levi, Mustang and the Guardians will try to insert the monster into the gadget, then I’ll lock the door and will start the gadget #008.1.3”</p>
                <p>Then Mustang, Levi and the Pokemons started to attack the monster till it was being pushed back and was inserted into the gadget. Okabe locked the door.</p>
                <p>“Samuel, tell me what was the time when Mr Richards disappeared?” said Okabe.</p>
                <p>“5’o clock in the evening. But why?” said Samuel.</p>
                <p>Then Okabe typed on his phone (which works as a remote of the gadget): 1-7-0-0-#</p>
                <p>The gadget started working. It started to vibrate. After half a minute, the gadgets work was completed. Inside of the gadget was filled with smoke. Okabe opened the door. A dark small figure was walking out of the gadget.</p>
                <p>It was Mr Richards. But How??</p>
