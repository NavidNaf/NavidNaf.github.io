                <p>MOOCs are very well established and a gateway to learning what you desire effectively. A massive open online course is an online course aimed at unrestricted participation and open access across the internet.</p>
                <p>During this phase of the pandemic, quarantine has led many learners to autodidacticism, self-learn. But in my linked in profile page, when I skim through my feed, I find the whole thing spammed with certificates, which obviously isn’t
                    a bad thing. It’s an appreciable thing.</p>
                <p>So, why I am writing this down –</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>To make the readers understand and take the best way of MOOC learning.</li>
                    <li>Find the strategy of learning.</li>
                    <li>Help them learning.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>So let’s start with the MOOCs, what they are and the best MOOCs currently on the web:</p>
                <h4>MOOC</h4>
                <p>A MOOC certificate is not the same as a college degree, MOOCs offer access to world-class education to anyone with an internet connection that opens up a world of possibilities. For example, a high school student may take a MOOC that helps
                    them to decide which career path is right for them (before wasting time and money to a degree that they can’t or don’t want to use). In addition, those who can’t afford to leave their job to go back to school or change their career
                    direction should take MOOCs in their spare time.</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td colspan="2">
                            The Basics of MOOC
                        </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Massive</td>
                        <td>A large number of students will take the same course at the same time.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Open</td>
                        <td>Anyone can enjoy the benefits of the courses, irrespective of their academic achievement. It could be free or low cost compared to higher degrees.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Online</td>
                        <td>The whole learning process is online, so anyone with an internet connection can easily access it.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td>Courses</td>
                        <td>MOOCs are built from the ground up to be effective for online learning. And when the latest trend arrives, it’s changed.</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <h4>Some Common MOOCs and FAQ</h4>
                <h4>Coursera</h4>
                <p>Best for students who want to have access to the most MOOCs and the widest range of learning pathways. The biggest benefit of Coursera is size – it has the most MOOCs, the most learning paths, the most partner organizations, and offers
                    the most languages. Coursera’s affiliate universities also have the highest overall ranking.</p>
                <p>Coursera Qualifications are respected by various universities around the world, as it has a wide-ranging approach to learning and has revised courses and programs. This MOOC is also perfect for attracting HRs.</p>
                <p>Easy for Financial Aids. The audit course does not feature quizzes and assignments to rank you. The range of courses are limited but the variety within the range.</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>FAQ</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><em>Does this help you with learning?</em><br>Ans – Yes, of course. The amount of videos, readings, and projects you’ll go through is great for your learning. Most Coursera courses are approved by the universities that offer the
                            course. But, to be sure, you will have to review each course on your homepage.</td>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><em>Does this help to enhance my CV?</em><br>Ans – Yes, the courses are conducted by University Professors or Big Organization personnel, so you can easily add it to CV.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><em>Will this help in my Higher Studies?</em><br>Ans – It might. It depends solely on the teachers. But, if the teacher admires online learning Coursera is the best option for it. But of course, the higher study should align with
                            your online course.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><em>Will this land me a job?</em><br>Ans – Yes, but slight. It will help you with the initial assessments. Not the rest recruitment process. The skills you learn from Coursera courses are 100% trustworthy. Nevertheless, whether
                            the employer accepts Coursera courses as credible will depend on them.</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <h4>edX</h4>
                <p>Best for those who want to have access to free courses on a wide variety of topics. If you are looking for a wide variety of MOOCs, I’d suggest edX. The platform offers courses in 30 different academic categories. The other sites prefer
                    to concentrate on technology lessons, but if you want to take a course like “Ancient Egyptian Civilization,” edX is your best bet. This MOOC is also perfect for attracting HRs.</p>
                <p>Wide range of courses. But Financial Aid does not waive the whole course like coursera.</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>FAQ</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><em>Does this help you with learning?</em><br>Ans – Yes, of course. The amount of videos, readings you’ll go through is great for your learning. But the amount of project is less than coursera.</td>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><em>Does this help to enhance my CV?</em><br>Yes, the courses are conducted by University Professors, so you can easily add it to CV.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><em>Will this help in my Higher Studies?</em><br>Ans – It might. It depends solely on the teachers. But, if the teacher admires online learning edX is the second option for it. But of course, the higher study should align with
                            your online course. The second option because the process of assessing is not as great as coursera.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><em>Will this land me a job?</em><br>Ans – Yes, but slight. It will help you with the initial assessments. Not the rest recruitment process. Nonetheless, if the result indicator is work worthy, you will need to go beyond just completing
                            the course. No employer would offer you a job because you have edX qualifications on your resume in slightly related fields.</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <h4>Udemy</h4>
                <p>Udemy strives to be an online training site where you can think about everything. There are over 100,000 Udemy courses. Some concentrate on technical skills, while others concentrate on hobby learning (including learning how to play video
                    games). Employers should have access to the most common Udemy courses for their workers to enable them to learn. It allows anyone to teach, not confined to only universities.</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>FAQ</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><em>Does this help you with learning?</em><br>Ans – Yes. Udemy provides a wide range of courses according to your preference.</td>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><em>Does this help to enhance my CV?</em><br>Ans – No. It just enhances your skills. It is not a material to put it in the CV as a License, Certificate or Accreditation.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><em>Will this help in my Higher Studies?</em><br>Ans – No. It will just enhance your skills.</td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><em>Will this land me a job?</em><br>Ans – It might. It depends on the HR Manager solely.</td>
                    </tr>
                </table>
                <h4>LinkedIn Learning</h4>
                <p>There’s an old saying that says something like this-“Content is King.” This can’t be truer than when we’re talking about online course providers. Courses are the only reason why people come to the site-it is only fair that the organization
                    should have the best and strictest quality management program in place.</p>
                <p>However, according to a lot of LinkedIn Learning feedback, it seems like the site can’t really claim that it has the best courses out there. On the contrary, students say that the courses are simply quite mediocre, in addition to the other
                    problems they face.</p>
                <p>First of all, there is a large number of LinkedIn Learning reviews that are frustrated by the lack of more comprehensive on-site courses. Students say that the site is dominated by beginner-oriented courses, and it’s really difficult to
                    find anything that’s a little more advanced.</p>
                <table>
                    <tr>
                        <td>FAQ</td>

                    <tr>
                        <td><em>Does this help you with learning?</em><br>Ans – Yes, of course. The amount of videos, readings you’ll go through is great for your learning. But there is no project or assignment in maximum courses.</td>

                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                        <td><em>Does this help to enhance my CV?</em><br>Ans – No. It’s a platform to build you. And most importantly when you are in a job, you will be constantly monitored by HR Manager. This course help you to continue education nothing
                            helps. It is valuable to get promotion or to show that you are going through constant learning.</td>
                    </tr>

                    <tr>
                        <td><em>Will this land me a job?</em><br>Ans – It might. Depends on the HR Manager solely. Employers tend to recruit (and promote) employees who are interested in improving/learning. People who are inspired and who want to succeed.</td>

                <h4>Strategic Learning – How to?</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Set the goal.</li>
                    <li>Surf the net with what you need to know or go through to improve yourself towards that goal. Create your own learning path.</li>
                    <li>Look for courses that correspond to your learning path.</li>
                    <li>Before beginning a course, go through the syllabus, what it’s all about. And the ratings, too.</li>
                    <li>Select courses with more than 4.5 Star ratings.</li>
                    <li>See the comments of the lowest ratings for a better picture.</li>
                    <li>Choose the course wisely, and at least devote the time to the course. Don’t hurry up. Track through your learnings. Certificates are not going to help you. The subjects are going to be. So take note of the main learnings and keep track
                        of your progress.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>How to Set Goals</h4>
                <p>You can consider the following strategies to set or align your goals –</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Ask yourself what you want to do.</li>
                    <li>Ask yourself what you can do.</li>
                    <li>Ask yourself what I need more to enhance me.</li>
                    <li>Don’t make others a competition, make yourself the competition.</li>
                </ol>
                <h4>Conclusion</h4>
                <p>Learning is a very useful operation. Strategically, learning is more important. Training depends on your agenda. If your goal is to learn: do whatever you can. Be nuts about it. But if you want to land on a stable life, a decent career,
                    a chance at a high level of higher education: strategic planning is a must. Hope this article helps you.</p>
